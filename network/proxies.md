# Proxies

Forward proxies act on behalf of the client, concealing the client to servers that the client interact with. These proxies can be used for e.g. VPN-like setups.

Reverse proxies act on behalf of the server, concealing the server to the clients that interact with it. Reverse proxies are typically used for load-balancing or routing.
