# ICMP

**Internet Control Message Protocol** (**ICMP**) is an alternative to UDP/TCP
that is often used for relying error message or running diagnostics.

According to the RFC standard all devices must response to ICMP packets,
however, it is often disabled for the sake of security. Many firewalls block
ICMP.
