# Internet Protocol

One of the most established protocols is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP is
responsible for delivering data from one computer to another. It accomplishes
this by dividing the data into small packages, each containing a header with
target destination and a data body. Each package is then forwarded through the
optimal route for the network and arrives at its destination, but not
necessarily in the original order.

The computers that are part of a network can see all data being transmitted over
the network. Hence, when wanting to transmitting themselves it is possible that
that the network already is in use. If this is the case, they wait a random time
and checks if its free. The reason the time is random is in case several
computers are waiting and to avoid that they all wakes up and tries to connect
at the same time.

One upside with IP, is that it allows parts of a network to become a
sub-network, where a switch (or router) decides what communication goes between
the parent and child network. This reduces network traffic, as not all traffic
on the parent network is forwarded to the child and so on. It also alleviates
the requirement of global node ids, as a node only need to have a unique id
inside its local network.
