# DHCP

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol** (**DHCP**) is a protocol for dynamically
assign IP addresses. A device gets an IP from a DHCP server. Can also assign
DNS, default gateway and network mask. IP addresses are given as time-limited
leases.

For example, one can run a DHCP query using the network utility `nmap` as done
below.

```sh
sudo nmap --script broadcast-dhcp-discover
