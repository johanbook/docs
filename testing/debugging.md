# Debugging

Debugging is the art of inspecting an application to understand in detail how it
is working. It also means finding a bug in an application.

When debugging one typically uses a _debugger_ which is a special type of
software often distributed as part of a language's SDK. For example, there is
`gdb` which is the GNU Debugger for debugging binary applications. There is also
`pdb` which is the official Python debugger.
