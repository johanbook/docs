# Linting

In contrast to tests that are executed at run time, one can also run code
through static code analysis. This is referred to as linting. Linting can be
used to find syntax errors, styling issues and undesired patterns.

Using linting in a project **is a must**. One should always use the strictest
possible settings from start.
