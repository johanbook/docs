# Dependencies

When developing there are a few things one needs:

- A compiler / interpreter
- An IDE
- Package manager and dependencies

Here we will discuss the last point in the list. Most projects use some form of
dependencies. One typically wants to install dependencies on a project-basis
rather than globally to avoid version conflicts (and to allow reproducibility).
This is called a virtual environment (at least within the Python domain).
