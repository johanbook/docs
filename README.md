# docs

**docs** are my coding docs. They are written
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and compiled to at static site using
the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) framework.

## Development

To start a development server run

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The docs are hosted on Github pages and are built as part of a CD pipeline. The
compilation is done using Node v16 (LTS).
