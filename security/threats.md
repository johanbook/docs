# Threats

There are many types of threats but typically an attacker wishes to

- gain access to a system they are not part of (authentication)
- gain access to resources they are not allowed to access (authorization)

First, let us consider what threats there actually are. Attacks can generally be
categorized as the following;

## Brute force attacks

A brute force attack consist of trying a vast amount of different passwords in
order to gain access to a system.

## Backdoor

A method to bypass authentication. Can be legitimate or implemented by a
malicious part.

## Vulnerabilities

Some common vulnerabilities are documented [here](vulnerabilities).
