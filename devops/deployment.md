# Deployment

Once an application is ready for production it is time for deployment. There are
tons of different deployment strategies, but here is an overview of some common
ones.

## Linux server

The old school hosting option is to run one's own bare metal Linux server. This
gives you full control but it does require you to manually perform maintenance
on the server such as security updates and installation of new versions of your
software. It is not playing as nicely with CI/CD as Cloud Foundry and
Kubernetes.

## Cloud foundry

Cloud Foundry is a technology for automatically building apps ready for
deployment directly from source code. The Cloud Foundry service analyzes your
code to see what language it is and then employs a suiting buildpack (a script
for compiling the app). It then configures the app, does some health checks and
deploys it. Examples of providers of Cloud Foundry are: Heroku and IBM.

## Docker Swarm

Docker swarm allows one run a swarm of Docker containers. It is similar to
Docker compose, but more suitable to deployment as it features orchestration and
cluster management. It is not as full-fledged (and as complicated) as
Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](kubernetes) is a technology mainly for deploying Docker images and
does load balancing, handling worker nodes and all for you.
