# CI/CD

CD (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment) are two concepts
essential to the modern software industry. The basic idea is that whenever code
is pushed to a repository a pipeline is triggered. This pipeline can run
testing, linting and even deployments.

In continuous integration you typically run a test pipeline to confirm tests
pass. In continuous deployment you also deploy the changes.
