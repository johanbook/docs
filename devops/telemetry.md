# Telemetry

Telemetry can be used to monitor a system.

## MELT

One typically wants to track Metrics, Events, Logs and Traces (MELT) of an
application.

## Logging

Logs are events logs. One should typically add a correlation id to requests
incoming to the stack.

For microservices, one typically wants a centralized logging solution.

## Monitoring

Metrics are recorded performance values.

## Tracing

Traces are request traces.
