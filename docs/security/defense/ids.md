# IDS

An **intrusion detection system** (**IDS**), sometimes **intrusion prevention
system** (**IPS**), is a system for detecting intrusion attempts. It does so by
inspecting e.g. network activity, system calls and hardware metrics.

## Signature vs anomaly detection

An IDS can use either a signature or anomaly based model.

### Signature based detection

A signature based model often has no false alarms, however they do not work as
well with the latest treats.

### Anomaly detection

An anomaly based model relies on machine learning. They are better at catching
new threats then signature-based detection but have more false alarms.
