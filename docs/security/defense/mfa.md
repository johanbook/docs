# Multi-factor authentication

**Multi-factor authentication** (**MFA**) is an authentication approach where a
user must prove they have multiple factors. Some common factors are:

- **Knowledge**, such as a password.
- **Possession**, such as a mobile phone or an USB stick.
- **Inherence**, biometrics such as fingerprint, eye iris or voice.
- **Location**, where the user is.

The higher the number of factors, the higher the security.

## Two-factor authentication

**Two-factor authentication** is a form of MFA where only factors are required.
This is used for e.g. bank cards (using a PIN to prove knowledge and the
physical card to prove possession).

## Mobile phones in MFA

Mobile phones are commonly used to prove possession in MFA, typically using an
authentication app that generates time based codes.
