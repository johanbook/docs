# Multi-factor authentication

**Multi-factor authentication** (**MFA**) is an authentication approach that
uses multiple factors. To authenticate to a system using MFA, a user prove at
least two of the following:

- Knowledge, such as a password.
- Possession, such as a mobile phone, USB stick.
- Inherence, biometrics such as fingerprint, eye iris and voice.
- Location, where the user is.

## Two-factor authentication

Requiring two of these is called two-factor authentication. This is used for
e.g. bank cards (using a PIN to prove knowledge and the physical card to prove
possession).
