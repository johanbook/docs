# Security By Design

**Security by design** is a mindset in software engineering. Some examples of
principles are the following:

- **Principle of least privilege** A system component should not have access to
  more than what it needs.
- **Avoid complexity** Makes systems harder to analyze.
- **Isolate and separate** parts of the system.
- **Design for change**
- **Fault tolerance** being able to continue working even though errors and
  ongoing attacks. This also implies that there should be no single point of
  failure.
