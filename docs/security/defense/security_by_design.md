# Security By Design

Software are designed with security in mind.

- **Principle of least privilege** A system component should not have access to
  more than what it needs.
- **Avoid complexity** Makes systems harder to analyze.
- **Isolate and separate** parts of the system.
- **Design for change**
- **Fault tolerance** being able to continue working even though errors and
  ongoing attacks. No single point of failure.
