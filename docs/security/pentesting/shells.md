# Shells

The initial goal of offensive pentesting is often to obtain a **shell**. One can
either have start a bind shell which will create a shell for incoming
connections. However, it is more common to use a reverse shell in order to evade
firewalls / IDS.

Common tools for obtaining shells are netcat, [telnet](../../network/telnet) and
[socat](../../network/socat).

## Web shells

A shell that is running through the browser. Can be via e.g. and uploaded PHP
file.

## Shell stabilization

The initially acquired shell are often unstable. Here are some techniques for
stabilization:

- Run `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash"')` to get a better shell
- Run `export TERM=xterm` to enable commands such as `clear`
- Background the shell and run `stty raw -echo;fg`
