# Uploads

If the backend supports PHP one can gain a [shell](./shells) by uploading a
reverse shell PHP.

## Extensions

There can be server side extension black- or white-lists. In this case it's
useful to test different allowed PHP extensions.

## Magic number

There can be magic number checks on server side. This can be evaded by changing
the magic number in a tool like `hexer`. A list magic number can be found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures).
