# Phishing

**Phishing** is an attack where victims are contacted via e.g. email or
telephone and are lured into giving up sensitive information or download
malware. These kind of attacks are often carried out en masse.

## Spear phishing

**Spear phishing** is similar to regular phishing, but has very specific
targets. Such as individuals with high positions. These attacks have messages
tailored for their targets.
