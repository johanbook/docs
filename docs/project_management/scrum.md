# Scrum

**Scrum** is an agile project management methodology.

## Roles

A scrum team should have the following roles:

- **Project manager** (**PM**)
- **Product owner** (**PO**)
- **Scrum master** ensures that the team follows the Scrum methodology.

## Sprints

The project development takes place iteratively in sprints.

## Daily scrums

The team has short meetings every day (typically 10 minutes or shorter) to
assess the progress.

### Retrospectives

After each sprint, the team met for a retrospective to discuss how the iteration
went and what could be improved.
