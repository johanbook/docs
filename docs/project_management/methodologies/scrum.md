# Scrum

**Scrum**, short for **Systematic Customer Relation Unraveling Meeting**, is an
agile project management methodology which highlights adaptability. Scrum is a
great fit for when project requirements may change.

Scrum works in iterations, called sprints. Each sprint is often 3-4 weeks.

## Roles

A team following Scrum is called a Scrum team and should have the following
roles:

- **Product owner** (**PO**)
- **Scrum master** ensures that the team follows the Scrum methodology.
- **Team members** are the remaining part of the team.

## Artifacts

There are three types of artifacts

### Product backlog

The backlog consist of items (shortened PBIs) which should done as part of the
project.

### Sprint backlog

The sprint backlog consist of items to be done in the current sprint.

### Burndown

The burndown chart is a diagram of the progress of the current project. This can
be used to indicate early for the Scrum master, if there are troubles in the
sprint.

## Ceremonies

There are several recurring traditions, called ceremonies, in Scrum, which are
used to review the development of the project, plan it and steer it in the right
direction.

### Spring planning

Stories are ranked and the ones with important are included in the coming
sprint.

### Daily scrums

The team has short meetings every day (typically 10 minutes or shorter) to
assess the progress. Here each member will report on what is being worked on and
if there are any blockers. Typically, the PO should not be part of the daily
scrum.

### Sprint review

In the sprint review, the scrum team will review how a completed sprint went.

### Retrospectives

After each sprint, the team met for a retrospective to discuss how the iteration
went and what could be improved.
