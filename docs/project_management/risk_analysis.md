# Risk analysis

**Risk analysis** is a part of project management. One needs to identify the
probability of that something goes wrong and the negative consequences of it.

## Types of risks

There are multiple types of risk:

- **Financial**
- **Human**
- **Natural**
- **Operational**
- **Political**
- **Procedural**
- **Project**
- **Reputation**
- **Structural**
- **Technical**

## Estimation of risk value

The risk value is determined from the probability of the event and the cost of
it. This should later be added in a risk probability chart.

## Risk management

There are multiple ways of handling a risk:

- **Avoid it** if the risk is too costly, one can consider to avoid the event
  the causes the risk to begin with.
- **Share it** share the risk with other partners. For example, get an
  insurance.
- **Accept it** is a risk has low risk value, or there is little one can do in
  preventive actions, one often has to simply accept the risk.
- **Control it** is taking preemptive actions against the risk, such as
  preventive actions (e.g. implementing a
  [firewall](../security/defense/firewall.md)) and detective actions (e.g.
  implementing an [IDS](../security/defense/ids.md)).
