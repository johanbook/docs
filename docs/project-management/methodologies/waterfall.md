# Waterfall

**Waterfall** is the traditional project methodology for developing software. It
is suitable for projects where the requirements are not subject to change.
Otherwise, an agile approach, such as [Scrum](./scrum/README.md), is more
suitable.

## Phases

Each phase can take for example 3-6 months, which is in contrast to
e.g.[Scrum](./scrum/README.md) where one phase (iteration) should not be longer
than a month.

### Planning

The project is planned.

### Building

The project is built.

### Testing

The project is tested.

### Release

The project is released.
