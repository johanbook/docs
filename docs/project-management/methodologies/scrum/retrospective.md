# Retrospective

**Retrospective** is a sprint tradition in [SCRUM](./README.md) in where at the
end of each sprint, the SCRUM team meet to evaluate how the sprint went and what
can be improved.

## 4L

The **4L** method is an approach in retrospectives in where each member of the
SCRUM team writes down a few points according to

- Liked
- Learned
- Lacked
- Longed for

The points in the lacked and longed-for categories are clustered together and
discussed by the team.
