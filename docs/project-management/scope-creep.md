# Scope creep

**Scope creep**, or **requirement creep**, is when the scope grows compared to
the original scope. This can be due to unexpected complexity or hidden
requirements, or by unintentionally adding new requirements.

## Avoiding scope creep

To avoid scope creeping, one should be aware of when and why it happens. One
should also revisit the original scope when adding or changing requirements (or
suggested solution).
