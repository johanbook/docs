# XML

**eXstenisible Markup Language** (**XML**) is a markup language for arbitrary
data. One common example is [HTML](./html.md). An example of XML is shown below:

```xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<cat>
  <name>Caty</name>
  <age>12</age>
</cat>
```

A document may start with a XML Prolog which states XML version.

## DTD

**Document Type Definition** (**DTD**) is a schema language that can be used to
validate XML documents.

## Other

There is a security vulnerability known as
[XXE](../../security/vulnerabilities/xxe).
