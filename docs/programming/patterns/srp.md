# Single Responsibility Principle

The **Single Responsibility Principle** (**SRP**) is a principle that states
that a module should only ever have one reason to change. This can also be
considered that a module, piece of code or a system should only have one
responsibility. It can be expressed as "should do one thing only and do it
well".

It is similar to the Unix principle.

## Flag arguments

A flag argument is a sign that a function does more than one thing. Then the
single responsibility of this function should be to delegate the work to other
functions.
