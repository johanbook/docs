# Text encoding

A **text encoding** is an approach to storing text ([strings](./strings.md)) in
memory.

## ASCII

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character
encoding standard using seven bits per character. For example, the word `ascii`
would be encoded as

```sh
Decimal: 97 115 99 105 105
Hexadecimal: 61 73 63 69 69
Binary: 01100001 01110011 01100011 01101001 01101001
```

## Unicode

Unicode is an encoding standard that uses variable byte lengths. Common
characters are encoded in fewer bytes.
