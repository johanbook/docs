# UI Design Patterns

Here are some UI design patterns.

## Model View Controller

Model View Controller (MVC) is a model consist of model, view and controller.
The Controller would handle incoming user events and interact with the Model.
The Model would manipulate the data (and perform business logic) and trigger
events in the View. This means that both the Controller and View are dependent
on the Model. This did not fully account for e.g. handling databases etc.
