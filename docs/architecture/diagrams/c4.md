# C4

**C4** is a standardized way of visualizing the workings of a software system.
It breaks the system down into four different levels of varying granularity. See
[c4model.com](https://c4model.com/).

## Context

The highest level of granularity is the **context** level which illustrates how
the whole software system is used and fits into the real world.

The context diagram can be shown to non-technical people.

## Containers

The **container** level shows the running application and data store that built
up the software system. Each container corresponds to a separate runnable /
deployable.

The container diragram also shows major technologies and communication protocols

## Component

The **component** level shows the largest abstract building blocks within a
container.

## Code

A **code diagram** describes how the actual code works. It can be e.g. a
[UML diagram](./uml.md). These diagrams are often less important then the other
levels and should only be created when needed.
