# Requirements analysis

**Requirements analysis** is vital before and during building a software system.
It is part of the requirements engineering process and takes place after the
requirements have been elicited.

Requirements can be divided into functional and non-functional. Functional
requirement are typically explicitly covered by users stores while the
non-functional ones tend to be implicit. Examples of non-functional requirements
are security and performance concerns.

Requirements should be categorized using the
[ISO/IEC 25010](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010)
standard.

Always break requirements into smaller requirements and number them so that each
have a unique ID.

## Stakeholders

There are following types of stakeholders:

- **Direct stakeholders** directly impacted by the system.
- **Indirect stakeholders** need to be aware of the system and its development.
  For example, external partners.
