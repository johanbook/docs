# Types of software

There are multiple types of software.

- **Enterprise** which often are very complex and a vast number of features.
  Response times and scalability might not be a concern.
- **Public** often has scalability and high availability but might not be as
  complex.
- **Scientific** focuses on correctness and robustness. Number of features might
  be small and response times might be less prioritized.
