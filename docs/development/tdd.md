# Test-driven development

**Test-driven development** (**TDD**) is a form of development where one writes
the tests before implementing the functionality.

Advantages of using TDD are the following:

- knowing when the code is good enough and prevents over-engineering
- helps creating better APIs
- can help breaking down complex requirements
- confidence in code

## Workflow

The TDD workflow is as follows:

1. Create a unit tests. Make sure it compiles and fails.
2. Implement the functionality such that the tests pass.
3. Refactor and cleanup test.
