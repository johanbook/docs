# Testing

**Testing**, or **dynamic testing** to be precise, is done to confirm that
software behaves as intended. This can be done by writing
[automated tests](./automated_testing/README.md) or by writing and executing
manual tests cases. This is contrast to
[static code analysis](../static_code_analysis.md) which can be done without
running the program itself.

## Manual testing

**Manual testing** is typically when a tester writes and executes test cases.
This can be either black-box or white-box testing.

### White-box testing

**White-box testing**, also known as **structural testing**, when one tests a
system with knowledge of its internal workings.

### Black-box testing

**Black-box testing**,also known as **functional testing**, is when one tests a
system with no prior knowledge of its internal workings.
