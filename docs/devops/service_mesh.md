# Service Mesh

A **Service Mesh** is a component that is responsible for service discovery and
which services as are allowed to communicate with each other. This is crucial in
micro-service architectures.

A service mesh often offers some form of name resolution in queries, alleviating
individual services needing to know the IP addresses of other services.
