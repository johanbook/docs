# Uptime

**Uptime** is a measure of availability for an application. There are different
uptime requirements for different sectors, for example a banking solution might
require a 99.999% uptime guarantee but a small-scale booking application might
do with 99%.

When using a cloud provider, uptime guarantees should be stated in the
[SLA](../laws/sla.md).

## Examples

| SLA     | Monthly downtime |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| 90%     | 3 days           |
| 99%     | 7 hours          |
| 99.9%   | 1 hour           |
| 99.99%  | 4 minutes        |
| 99.999% | 30 seconds       |
