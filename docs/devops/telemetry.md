# Telemetry

**Telemetry** is monitoring a live system and transmitting it to receiver. It is
crucial in order to improve performance, troubleshoot problems and mitigate
attacks.

## MELT

One important concept is **MELT**, is **Metrics, Events, Logs and Traces**.

## Logging

Logs are events logs. One should typically add a correlation id to requests
incoming to the stack.

## Monitoring

Metrics are recorded performance values.

## Tracing

Traces are request traces.

## Architecture

One typically wants a centralized logging solution. For larger systems one
should also have backups.
