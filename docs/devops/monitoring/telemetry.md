# Telemetry

**Telemetry** is monitoring a live system and transmitting it to receiver. It is
crucial in order to improve performance, troubleshoot problems and mitigate
attacks.

## MELT

Monitoring can be divided into **Metrics, Events, Logs and Traces** (**MELT**).

### Logs

Logs are events logs. One should typically add a correlation id to requests
incoming to the stack.

### Metrics

Metrics are recorded performance values.

### Tracing

Traces are request traces.
