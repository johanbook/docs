# CNN

A **Convolutional Neural Network** (**CNN**) is an [ANN](../ann.md) that uses a
kernel with learnable weights. This allows the network to learn local features
without needing an absurd amount of complexity. It is commonly used for computer
vision problems, such as
[image classification](../../problem_types/image_classification.md) and
[object detection](../../problem_types/object_detection.md).

## VGG

**VGG**, named after Visual Geometry Group, is an architecture that stacks many
convolutional layers on top of each other.
