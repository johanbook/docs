# Reinforcement learning

**Reinforcement learning** (**RL**) is an approach to training a
[neural network](../ann.md), where the network takes a series of actions and is
rewarded or punished based on the result. Reinforcement learning allows training
machine learning algorithms that supersedes humans, something that is not
possible with classical [supervised learning](./supervised_learning.md).
