# CNN

A **Convolutional Neural Network** (**CNN**) is type of network that uses a
kernel with learnable weights. This allows the network to learn local features
without needing an absurd amount of complexity.

One architecture is VGG, named after Visual Geometry Group, that stacks
ridiculously many convolutional layers on top of each other.
