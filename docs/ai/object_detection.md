# Object detection

 **Object detection** is when one detects objects with
bounding boxes in video and images.

## IoU

Intersection over Union (IoU) is a measurement that can be used to determine how
much two bounding boxes overlap. Given an IoU threshold one can estimate if two
bounding boxes are the same.
