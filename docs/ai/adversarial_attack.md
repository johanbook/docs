# Adversarial attack

An **adversarial attack** is where one attempts to fool an AI by making small
changes to its input data. This can allow attackers to create media (such as
songs, photos and videos) such that they are interpreted as something completely
different to what humans would. A song could be interpreted as voice commands.

Adversarial attacks could become a serious threat in the future.
