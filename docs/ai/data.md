# Data

In order to build any model one needs data. However, before starting the
modelling process you need to prepare the data. This involves various different
stages, which will be outlined in this document. Which stages that are relevant
depends on the domain of the data.

There are various techniques: wrangling, Extract Transform Load (ETL).

## Gathering

Data needs to be gathered. This can be done e.g. manually or semi-automatically.

## Annotation

Commonly one needs to annotate the data, meaning one adds additional
information. For [object detection](./object_detection) one would draw bounding
boxes and specify target classes for each box.

## Cleaning

Do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to see what cleaning is needed to be done.

## Governance

Is is important mkey?
