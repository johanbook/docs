# Object detection

**Object detection** is when one detects objects with bounding boxes in video
and images. It can be used for e.g. face detection.

One typically uses a [CNN](../ann/network_types/cnn.md) for solving object
detection problems.

## IoU

**Intersection over Union** (**IoU**) is a measurement that can be used to
determine how much two bounding boxes overlap. Given an IoU threshold one can
estimate if two bounding boxes are the same.
