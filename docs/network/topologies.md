# Network topologies

There are different topologies for how a network can be setup. Here are a few.

## Ring topology

Every computer is connected to two other computers. This means that if one
computer or cable goes down the whole thing goes down.

## Bus topology

All computers are connected to a single cable (the backbone). Cannot handle a
large amount of data.

## Star topology

All devices are connected to a central hub. It's common.
