# Basics of networks

Here is some basic terminology;

- **Latency** - the time it takes for data to get one one point to another in a
  system.
- **Throughput** - how many operations a machine in a system can perform. E.g
  how many requests a server can respond to.
- **High Availability** - meaning that a system has high availability. Is often
  shortened as HA.

## Types of networks

- **LAN** A Local Area Network is a network connected to a gateway / router.
- **WAN** A Wide Area Network consists of several LANs.
- **Overlay** A virtual network running on top of another network.

Other:

- **CAN** A Controller Area Network is a network commonly used in cars for
  different components to communicate with each other.

## Other network types

- **Peer-To-Peer / P2P** A network where in all machines have equal
  responsibilities (in e.g. distributing a file). This is in contrast to the
  server-client approach.
