# TCP

**Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**), also known as TCP/IP, is a protocol
built on top of the IP protocol and supports bidirectional communication (in
contrast to UDP). In TCP each transmitted package has a sequence number set in
its package header. This allows the receiver to rearrange the received packages
in their original order (which is no guarantee under IP itself). This sequence
number also serves as an identifier for an open connection from a given IP,
considering a single IP can have multiple connections. To establish a connection
both parties must know each other's Initial Sequence Number (ISN) for the
connection. This is established by the three-way handshake.

## The three-way handshake

To establish a TCP connection, which is bidirectional, both parties need ISNs.
This is accomplished in three steps

1. The client sends a synchronization request (SYN) containing an ISN.
2. The host answers with a combined message, an acknowledgement of the received
   SYN request (an ACK) and a SYN request with its own ISN.
3. Client answers with an ACK when the remote's SYN is received.

## Windowing

TCP was developed with post-world war scenarios in mind builds on the assumption
that network nodes may be flaky as best. Therefore, the number of packages sent
during a communication usually starts as 1, and then increases exponentially if
every transmission if successful. If a transmission fails, it resets back to 1.
