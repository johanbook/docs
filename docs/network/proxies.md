# Proxies

Forward proxies act on behalf of the client, concealing the client to servers
that the client interact with. These proxies can be used for e.g. VPN-like
setups.

Reverse proxies act on behalf of the server, concealing the server to the
clients that interact with it. Reverse proxies are typically used for
load-balancing or routing.
