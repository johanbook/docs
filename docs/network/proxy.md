# Proxy

A **proxy** is a component that forwards traffic to another unit in the network.

## Forward proxy

A **forward proxy** acts on behalf of a client, concealing the client to servers
that the client interact with. These proxies can be used for e.g.
[VPN](./vpn)-like setups.

## Reverse proxy

A **reverse proxy** acts on behalf of the server, concealing the server to the
clients that interact with it. Reverse proxies are typically used for
load-balancing or routing.
