# IP Address

An **IP address** is an address used for transmitting data using the
[internet protocol](./protocols/ip).

## Ipv4 vs IPv6

There are two major versions of IP addresses, IPv4 that uses 32 bit addresses
and IPv64 that uses 128 bits. The problem with IPv4 is that it only offers
$2^{32}$ unique addresses - which is of the same order as Earth's population.
IPv6 bumps this limit to $2^{128}$ which is unlikely that we hit in a
foreseeable future.

## Subnet mask

A IPv4 subnet mask consists of four bytes, often separated by dots when printed.
The purpose of a subnet mask is to show which part of an IP address that targets
a network and which targets a device.

## CIDR notation

CIDR is a notation for specifying a range of IP addresses.
