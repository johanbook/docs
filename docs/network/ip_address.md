# IP Address

An **IP address** is an address used for transmitting data using the
[internet protocol](/protocol/internet_protocol).

## Subnet mask

A subnet mask consists of four bytes, often separated by dots when printed. The
purpose of a subnet mask is to distinguish different ranges of an IP address.
