# SLA

**Service level agreement** (**SLA**) is an agreement to a service provider. It
can for example outline what compensation you get if service provider fails to
fulfill to deliver the service (e.g. availability)

An SLA may for example cover:

- **Data portability** how data is ported to another provider if the need would
  arise.
- **Get-out** process for terminating contract.
- **Penalties** penalties for failing to uphold contract, e.g. insufficient
  availability.
- **Response times** to answer issues
- **Uptime** what uptime should the service confer to.
