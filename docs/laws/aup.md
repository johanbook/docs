# AUP

An **Acceptable Use Policy** (**AUP**) is service provider policy limiting what
the provided services may be used for. A reasonable AUP will forbid the use of
services for illegal purposes, such as fraud and violation of intellectual
property.

Cloud providers may also forbid

- email spamming
- falsifying [TCP](../network/protocols/tcp.md) origin headers
- mining cryptocurrencies
