# Terminology

- **Deamon** is a process running in the background, not expecting interaction.
  Deamon processes traditionally has the suffix `d`. Deamons often has the init
  process as parent (which can be accomplished via adopting). For example, the
  [Docker](../devops/docker) deamon is called `dockerd`.
