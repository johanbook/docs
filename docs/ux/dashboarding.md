# Dashboards

A **Dashboard** is a GUI that displays various data visualizations. As a rule of
thumb, dashboards can be divided into categories.

## Strategic

Strategic dashboard shows KPIs and quick numbers. Should be fast and easy to
read. Would be of interest to C-level.

## Operational

Operational dashboard shows supporting information. Has more detailed graphs.
Would be interesting to managers.

## Analytical

Analytical dashboards allows users to perform EDAs and very granular analysis.
Would be interesting to specialists.
