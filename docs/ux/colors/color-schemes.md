# Color schemes

A color scheme typically contains one primary color and multiple secondary
colors.

## Basic schemes

There are multiple variants of color schemes, for example:

- **Analogous** uses colors that are adjacent on the color wheel.
- **Complementary** uses colors that are opposite on the color wheel. Attract
  attention from the user.
- **Monochromatic** is based on one single hue and works with lightness and
  saturation. Monochromatic schemas are often interpreted as soothing.
- **Split complementary** uses to colors adjacent to complementary color
- **Square** uses four evenly spaced colors on the wheel.
- **Tetradic** uses two colors in to complementary pairs.
- **Triadic** uses three, evenly spaced, colors on the wheel.

There should also be some neutral colors.
