# Colors

In order to create a good UI/UX, one needs to use colors to convey meaning and
harmony. This page will discuss what makes up colors and how one can create
color schemes.

## Basic properties of colors

One color has the following properties:

- **Hue** is the source color. These are shown on the color wheel.
- **Luminance**, also called **value**, is how light the color is.
- **Saturation**, also **intensity** or **chroma**, is the brightness or the
  dullness of the color. It can be how much white it is mixed into it.

  A color has the following

  - **Shades** the color mixed with black
  - **Tints** the color with white
  - **Tones** the color mixed with gray

## Color schemes

A color scheme typically contains one primary color and multiple secondary
colors.

There are multiple variants of color schemes, for example:

- **Analogous** uses colors that are adjacent on the color wheel.
- **Complementary** uses colors that are opposite on the color wheel. Attract
  attention from the user.
- **Monochromatic** is based on one single hue and works with lightness and
  saturation. Monochromatic schemas are often interpreted as soothing.
- **Split complementary** uses to colors adjacent to complementary color
- **Square** uses four evenly spaced colors on the wheel.
- **Tetradic** uses two colors in to complementary pairs.
- **Triadic** uses three, evenly spaced, colors on the wheel.

There should also be some neutral colors.

## How colors are experienced

Different colors are perceived in different ways. Although, it is quite
subjective, the following subconscious associations are common:

- **Black** power, sophistication
- **Blue** trust, comfort
- **Green** growth, success, nature.
- **Orange** energy
- **Red** danger
- **Purple** luxury, creativity,
- **Yellow** happiness
- **White** cleanliness

  also **RGBA** which supports an alpha channel.
