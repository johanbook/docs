# Components

When designing UI, there are recurring components (see
[atomic design](./atomic_design.md)). Note that the names of these components
can vary. I aim to follow the practices of
[Material Design](https://m3.material.io/components).

## Accordion

An **acordion** is a collapsible card.

## Badge

A **badge** is a component for displaying additional information next to another
component.

## Breadcrumbs

A set of hierarchical navigation links.

## Buttons

A **button** is a component that can be pressed. Buttons typically comes in the
following variants depending on how much of the user's attention they are
intended to draw:

- **Primary**
- **Secondary**
- **Tertiary**

Colors are typically

- Primary
- Secondary
- Success
- Error
- Warning

## Card

A **card** is a section for some dedicated content.

## Drawer

A sidebar that can be opened and closed. Typically used to display navigation or
supporting content.

## List

A list is for displaying data.

## Modal window

A **modal window** is a component that overlays all other UI in order to get the
user's attention.

## Navigation bar

A **navigation bar** is a component for quickly navigating between multiple
pages.

## Slider

A **slider** is a component for entering a bounded incremental value.

## Snackbar

A **snackbar**, sometimes called a **toast**, small bar that pops up in a corner
to display a message. Typically exists in the following variants:

- Info
- Success
- Error
- Warning

Should not be too distracting.

## Table

A **table** is a component for displaying data in columns. It typically supports
filtering and sorting on a column basis.

## Tooltip

A **tooltip** is a component for displaying additional information when another
component is focused.
