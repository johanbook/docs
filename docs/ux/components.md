# Components

These are some common components in GUI design.

## Breadcrumbs

A set of hierarchical navigation links.

## Drawer

A sidebar that can be opened and closed. Typically used to display navigation or
supporting content.

## Snackbar

A small bar that pops up in a corner to display a message. Should not be too
distracting.
