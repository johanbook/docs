# Atomic design

**Atomic design** is an approach to creating UI designs. It useful when building
e.g. component libraries.

In atomic design, UIs consists of

- **Atoms** is an element that cannot be broken down any further. Examples are
  labels, buttons and check boxes.
- **Molecules** is reusable group of atoms. For example, molecule could be a
  search from.
- **Organisms** is multiple molecules.
- **Templates**
- **Pages**

## Process

Atomic design incorporates a dynamic process, meaning what earlier was seen as
an atom can later be considered a molecule.
